# Book Recommendations App using GPT-4

This streamlit app uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model to provide the user with book recommendations based on three of their favorite books. I read a lot and recently created a Django app that automates certain Goodreads tasks such as fetching a user's goodreads recommendations from their profile. However I noticed that these recommendations weren't very good so I decided to try and make something that would provide more high quality book recommendations.

<br>
Part of the problem with Goodreads' recommendations is that it seems to overweight books recently added to the profile and doesn't consider which books are most important to the user.
<br>
<br
Therefore in this approach, the recommendations are only based off of a user's top 3 favorite books.

I used Langchain and Streamlit to create this project.
